  <description>Weapons Of Elysion is a mod that started on the unofficial rimworld discord that Mercury started and was making art for.
I (Yaluzan) took this chance to start modding rimworld, this is the first rimworld mod i did XML and programming.

This mod contains 2 new weapons.
The first gun is a Voltaic Hand-Cannon which functions as a Lightning Shotgun(proper shotgun pellets, not a single blast) which will burn anything it hits. Since it is lightning it will also function as an EMP weapon but it is a lot less strong than an EMP grenade or EMP mortar.

The second gun is a High Explosive Combat Rifle, As you can read from the name, its a rifle with bullets that explode upon impact. Its a small but strong explosion which might be lethal, even on the first hit. But this stopping power causes it to have bad accuracy and a long warmup/cooldown.
