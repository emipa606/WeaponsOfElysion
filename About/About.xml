Weapons Of Elysion is a mod that started on the unofficial rimworld discord that Mercury started and was making art for. 
I (Yaluzan) took this chance to start modding rimworld, this is the first rimworld mod i did XML and programming.

This mod contains 2 new weapons. 
The first gun is a Voltaic Hand-Cannon which functions as a Lightning Shotgun(proper shotgun pellets, not a single blast) which will burn anything it hits. Since it is lightning it will also function as an EMP weapon but it is a lot less strong than an EMP grenade or EMP mortar. Note: The gif shown above doesn't show all lightning strikes because of the amount of frames in the gif, one shoots out in the rough direction(can't be more accurate) of the target for every bullet that is shot.

The second gun is a High Explosive Combat Rifle, As you can read from the name, its a rifle with bullets that explode upon impact. Its a small but strong explosion which might be lethal, even on the first hit. But this stopping power causes it to have bad accuracy and a long warmup/cooldown.

Balance feedback is welcome:)
